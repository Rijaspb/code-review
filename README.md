# AI-Powered Code Reviewer (MERN Stack)

# Overview

This project is an AI-powered code review tool built using the MERN stack ( Express.js, React, and Node.js). It analyzes code, identifies potential issues, and suggests improvements based on best practices.
This tool is particularly useful for software developers, code reviewers, and engineering teams looking to improve their code quality efficiently.

# Key Features

â€¢	AI-Powered Code Review: Automatically detects issues in JavaScript/Node.js code and provides structured feedback.
â€¢	Syntax Highlighting: Displays properly formatted and color-coded code for easy readability.
â€¢	Detailed Issue Breakdown: Highlights problems like missing comments, bad practices, and security vulnerabilities.
â€¢	Suggested Fixes: Provides recommended changes following software engineering best practices.
â€¢	MERN Stack Implementation: Full-stack architecture ensuring seamless UI/UX and backend processing.
â€¢	Real-Time Code Analysis: Instant feedback upon submitting code snippets.

# Technologies Used

â€¢	Frontend: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS
â€¢	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
